Not everyone will want to practice what Kippley calls \"ecological breastfeeding\" or to use breastfeeding to space their children, but her book explains what that means for mothers. The book is excerpted in this article. Ecological breastfeeding is the form of nursing in which the mother fulfills her baby's needs for frequent suckling and her full-time presence and in which the child's frequent suckling postpones the return of the mother's fertility."
